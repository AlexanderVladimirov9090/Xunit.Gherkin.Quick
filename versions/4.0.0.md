# 4.0.0

## New Features

- [Handling Not-Implemented Feature Files](/docs/handle-not-implemented-feature-files.md)

## About Backwards Compatibility

This release is supposed to be backwards compatible with the previous versions. However, the new version will enforce discovery of the feature files that are not implemented yet but still are placed under the root directory of the project. Hence, some developers and consumers can be impacted by the upgrade.

If you upgraded to this new version and found that some new scenarios failed, that is probably because you didn't have them implemented yet. To resolve the issue, you need to either implement those scenarios (if you missed implementing them accidentally), or delete those feature files (if they were placed under the root folder by mistake), or [ignore them](/docs/ignore-scenario.md) (if you plan implementing them later), or rename them so that they don't match the feature file name pattern (if they are not features but just temporary files with valid Gherkin text in them). Either way, please refer to the documentation link provided above in the release notes for more details.
